This binding has no further development and is not supported anymore!
It is now part of the official Binding https://next.openhab.org/addons/bindings/fineoffsetweatherstation/
starting with Release 3.4.

## org.openhab.binding.ws980wifi-3.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 
This is an executable java file to manually store in openhab 3 addons folder.
For UNIX this is /usr/share/openhab/addons. 

The File provides a binding for openhab 3 to access weather data from ELV Weatherstation WS980WIFI.
For more information and source code please visit my fork of [openhab/openhab-addons](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons),
that is my repo [prof2004/openhab-addons](https://github.com/prof2004/openhab-addons.git).
The branch [ws980wifi](https://github.com/prof2004/openhab-addons/tree/ws980wifi/bundles/org.openhab.binding.ws980wifi) contains the binding.
